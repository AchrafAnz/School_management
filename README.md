this python code is for a software that manages students of a school ( or equivalent busineses ,you can change the code to make it adapted to your business) .
it offers you many features such as creating a list of students of a certain class of a certain subject , and you can manage monthly paiements of all these students by clicking on them and adding  or 
 deleting a paiement , also you can change all the informations of the students without deleting it and creating it again . 
this code is done on python using very simple front end library wich is tkinter , but with a great database library MySQL . as you know python is not made for software developpement , but i just wanted to make 
 such software to help my father in his business , and python was my favorite programming language because of its compatibilaty to Artificial intellignece . you will notice that the front end is like shit but as
 long as it's working , that's the most important thing for me .
